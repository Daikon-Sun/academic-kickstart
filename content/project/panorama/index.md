We construct panoramas from a series of photographs.
The following feature-based process is run through in the order to create panoramas:

* Feature detection: scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) or multi-scale oriented patches (MSOP), with the aid of exhaustive search.
* Feature matching: exhaustive search and Haarâ€™s method.
* Projection: cylindrical projection.
* Image stitching: bundle adjustment.
* Blending: multi-band blending.
