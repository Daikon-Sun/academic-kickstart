  Single-channel Multi-speaker Speech Separation (Ongoing)

  * Attempts to solve the cock-tail problem by temporal convolutional network.

  Modeling Multivariate Time Series

  * Proposed the Temporal Pattern Attention for modeling multivariate time series.
  * Classical attention mechanism can only capture few past events, but our attention is capable of capturing multiple past events.
  * Our model achieves state-of-the-art on forecasting multivariate time series, including music notes.

  Natural Language Processing

  * Implemented a unsupervised machine translation model based on CycleGAN.
  * Trained a chat-bot with reinforcement learning on the Cornell movie dialog corpus.

  Reinforcement Learning for Online Games

  * Trained a Slither.io agent by Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C).
  * The agent can efficiently eat candies while effectively dodge other players.

  Wirelength Model

  * Proposed the first gradient-based wirelength model for global placement.
  * Our wirelength model generates better solution on ISPD 2015 and 2016
    benchmarks with NTUPlace3.

  Bus Routing

  * Participated in 2018 ICCAD constest on bus routing, and won top 10.
  * Our router is based on the DAG-based topology-matching on-track bus routing algorithm.

  Detailed Routing **[ICCAD 2018]**

  * Participated in ISPD 2018 initial detailed routing contest, and won 3rd Place.
  * We are the first to achieve top 3 with pure undergraduates (excluding professor).
  * We proposed the two-stage multi-threaded negotiation-based initial detailed routing algorithm.

  Single Layer Global Routing

  * Implemented a single layer global routing algorithm based on mixture of previous literature and own thoughts.
  * The algorithm successfully routed many real industrial cases.
