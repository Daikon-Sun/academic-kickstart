  **Open-Set Multi-Speaker Speech Separation (Ongoing)**
    
  * Proposed to use the *phase information in complex domain* to improve performance.
  
  **Multivariate Time Series (MTS) Forecasting** ***[submitted to ECML/PKDD 19]***

  * Proposed the *temporal pattern attention for MTS forecasting*, which use CNNs to extract *temporal patterns across multiple time steps* instead of a single time step as in traditional attention mechanisms.
  * Verified by experiments, our attention is able to attend multiple time steps and handle interdependencies between series.
  * Achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of MTS datasets, including polyphonic music notes.
  
  **Natural Language Processing**

  * Developed a chat bot with a *seq2seq model with deep reinforcement learning* on the Cornell movie dialog corpus.
  * Researched the CycleGAN paradigm with LSTM to train unpaired machine translation.
  
  **Reviewed paper for ICASSP 2019**

  **Bivariate Gradient-based Wirelength Model** ***[submitted to DAC 19]***

  * Proposed a *novel bivariate gradient-based wirelength model* for global placement that combines the *advantages of bivariate and multivariate functions*.
  * Outperformed previous bivariate and state-of-the-art multivariate wirelength models.
  
  **Topology-Matching Bus Routing** ***[submitted to DAC 19]***

  * Proposed and implemented the *DAG-based topology-matching bus routing engine* and won the top 10 at 2018 ICCAD CAD contest.
  * Outperformed all participants of 2018 ICCAD CAD contest, where the 1st place router resulted in 145% higher cost.
  
  **Initial Detailed Routing** ***[ICCAD 18]***

  * Proposed and implemented the *multithreaded initial detailed routing engine that considers global guides* and won the 3rd place at the 2018 ISPD contest.
  * Accelerated the engine almost proportional to the number of threads.
  * Outperformed the winner of 2018 ISPD contest by 23%.
